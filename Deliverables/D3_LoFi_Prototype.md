## Summary
Current process of thinking mapping out all connections on a more vauge scale prior to moving down to the nitty gritty. I am still looking heavily in to exact connections within the SQL database I would require and how to link it all together. I have a general idea but I haven't drawn it out. I have decided to also look into making the graphs have some form of interactability since if I remember there are simple flags in most graphic modules to track mouse movement of X datapoint.
