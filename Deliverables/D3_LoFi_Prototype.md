## Reflection
My process for creating this lofi prototype was mostly thinking about internal programs I saw at my internship. Futhermore, thinking about making a UI with large and clear options with most advanced settings being deligated to other portions of the program, away from end-users. I wanted to keep UI as simplistic as posssible so any options pressed would open small windows to perform actions so clicking "Settings" would open a small menu for everything settings and etc. I am still thinking about how I want to handle reports and if it just going to be some simple PDF that opens upon request or some form of CSV that gets rendered in some fashion on the program. I found UI prototyping a bit challenging since I typically create alot of backend before working on end-user functions but this atleast gave me a general idea of where to start off with my prototype proper. I am feeling a bit confident on getting started as time draws near for our first implementations. My process was pretty simplistic in my option and was very iterative. I would create one main version then slowly mold it to my liking then create another major version then itterate that to see where it goes. I think current UI is pretty simplistic and clearly divided into easy visual chunks making it easier for one to navigate. Hopefully, I can start implementation soon as I create the proper enviorment for a basic prototype.
